## Hi there👋 
I’m an Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Currently, I am working on implementing several platforms such as GitHub, RStudio, SQL Developer, and Power BI to create cohesive **data projects**! For my programming projects, I usually only upload to GitHub once significant progress has been made. 

- ⚙️ I use `SQL`, `Java`, `R`, `Python` and visualization tools to develop thorough E2E data projects 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of working with Azure and Data Lakehouse architecture to learn more about data engineering!
